I used Tailwind CSS for styling, MongoDB and Mongoose for database connection and Redux/Redux-Toolkit for state management. Also, I integrated paypal payment method using React-Paypal-Js. React-Icons for all the icons, Axios for data fetching and JWT for client-side authentication. This shows my ability to work on a real world project and back-end knowledge to either communicate with back-end developers or be a full-stack developer. admin name: admin, password:1234",
