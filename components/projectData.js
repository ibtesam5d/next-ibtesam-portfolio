I used Tailwind CSS for responsive design, MongoDB and Mongoose for database connection and Redux/Redux-Toolkit for state management. Also, I integrated paypal payment method using React-Paypal-Js. React-Icons for all the icons, Axios for data fetching and JWT for client-side authentication. I utilized NextJs' built-in API route for cretaing API end-points. Additionally, I took advantage of Next Image component for image optimization and Server-Side Rendering for building faster and SEO friendly web-application. This shows my ability to work on a real world project and back-end knowledge to either communicate with or be a full-stack developer.",

I used 'display:grid' property for creating tiled style hero image section. Flying navigation and image carousel portrays JavaScript skill. I used Tailwind CSS as I love working with mobile first approach in responsive design and enjoy writing less code without leaving html. This landing page is fully responsive on multiple screen sizes and I used React-icons package for working with icons.",
